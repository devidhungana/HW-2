# HW-2
In this homework exercise, we created a web application that can function properly and can be accessed by anyone from anywhere. This was the introduction to ASP.Net Core MVC, we follow the tutorial step by step and successfully created a basic website. We have bunch of classes, database tables, controller, views, etc. Our web application is named MvcMovie, it's an web app where user can add, edit, delete, search, and view list of movies. There are buttons and links that allows user to do things and every links are functional.
This exercise was very helpful to understand the concepts for upcoming projects and other related assignments, and also very intersting. This gives an idea about what we will be doing in upcoming assignments and this was the very good assignment to get prepare and understand the stuff that we will be doing in the future.
